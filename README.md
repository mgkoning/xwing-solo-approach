# Approach Helper for X-wing Miniatures Game

Recently, Fantasy Flight Games published an open alpha of their X-wing Miniatures Game solo play 
rules. While playing, I kept having to flip back and forth to the approach and attitude charts.
This is a tool to automatically show approach, attitude and actions after entering the appropriate
variables (tally arc, defense die value and attack die value) to allow for faster play.
